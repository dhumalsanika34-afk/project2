        Tomato pizza ranges from authentic Italian styles, such as the cheese-less pizza marinara or pizza margherita using San Marzano tomatoes, to thick-crusted American tomato pies. Key features include high-quality, often uncooked or slightly cooked, tomato sauce, olive oil, and fresh herbs like basil. These pizzas are characterized by their simple, fresh, and often lower-calorie profile. 
Key Information & Characteristics
Best Tomatoes: San Marzano plum tomatoes are considered ideal for their flavor, often hand-crushed or blended.
Sauce Preparation: Many chefs prefer uncooked sauce for a fresher taste, or lightly simmering them with garlic, olive oil, and sometimes sugar to balance acidity.
Crust: Options include thin, crispy, or thicker focaccia-style crusts, sometimes pre-baked or baked at very high temperatures (450°F+ / 230°C+).
Toppings: While basic, popular additions include mozzarella (buffalo or fresh), fresh basil, garlic, oregano, and sometimes Parmesan or ricotta. 
Popular Varieties
Pizza Marinara: A simple, vegan-friendly Italian pizza with tomatoes, garlic, herbs, and olive oil.
Pizza Margherita: Features tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil.
Tomato Pie (Philadelphia Style): Often served at room temperature with a thick, focaccia-like crust and a sweet, savory tomato sauce. 
Tips for Success
Prevent Soggy Crust: Drain sliced tomatoes on a paper towel to remove excess moisture.
Storage: The sauce can be made 4-5 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator.
Cooking: If not using a pizza stone, baking at 200°C (390°F) for 6–8 minutes, or using a cast-iron pan on the stove, can produce a crisp result. 
A standard slice of tomato pizza is roughly 150-170 calories, making it a relatively light, traditional option.
