        Pizza Margherita is a classic Neapolitan pizza representing the Italian flag with red tomato sauce, white mozzarella (typically fior di latte or buffalo), and green fresh basil, topped with olive oil. It is characterized by a thin, soft, and airy crust with a raised edge (cornicione). Created in 1889 to honor Queen Margherita, it is known for its simple, fresh, and savory flavor. 
Key Characteristics and Ingredients:
Dough: Typically made from a simple mixture of 00 flour, water, salt, and yeast, resulting in a light and airy base.
Sauce: Simple, crushed, or pureed tomatoes (often San Marzano).
Cheese: Fresh mozzarella, such as fior di latte (cow's milk) or buffalo mozzarella.
Basil: Fresh, aromatic basil leaves, usually added before or after baking to enhance flavor.
Oil: A drizzle of high-quality extra virgin olive oil.
Baking: Traditionally cooked in a high-temperature wood-burning oven for a short time. 
The Margherita pizza is often considered the most traditional and popular pizza in Naples, often served with a 1/2 to 1-inch border of crust. The combination of the tangy tomatoes, rich cheese, and fresh basil offers a perfect balance of flavors.
