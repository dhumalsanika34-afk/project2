    A cheese pizza is a classic, widely popular dish consisting of a bread-based dough, tomato sauce, and cheese, most commonly mozzarella. It typically provides about 285 calories per 107g slice, offering a balance of carbohydrates, fat, and protein, and is often customizable with herbs or multiple cheese blends. 
Key Information About Cheese Pizza:
Ingredients: The core components are pizza dough (refined wheat flour, yeast, water), tomato-based sauce, and cheese, often mozzarella for its stretchiness, along with provolone, cheddar, or parmesan for flavor.
Nutritional Profile: A typical slice contains roughly 285 calories, 10-12g of fat, 35-36g of carbohydrates, and 12g of protein. It is a good source of calcium but can be high in sodium and saturated fat.
Common Varieties:
Classic: Mozzarella and tomato sauce.
Four Cheese (Quattro Formaggi): Often blends mozzarella, cheddar, gouda, and emmental.
White Pizza: Uses white sauces or no sauce, relying on cheeses like ricotta or mozzarella.
Preparation: Generally baked at high temperatures, around 425°F, for 10-15 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.
Health Considerations: While nutritious in terms of protein, it is moderate to high in sodium (approx. 640mg per serving) and fat. It should be consumed in moderation to manage saturated fat intake.
Origin: While modern pizza originated in Italy, flatbreads topped with cheese and herbs were consumed by ancient Greeks and Persians. 
Popularity and Tips:
"Cheese Burst" or Extra Cheese: Many commercial options are "cheese overload" styles for added flavor and texture.
Best Enjoyed Fresh: Cheese pizza is best consumed immediately after baking before the cheese becomes too firm or chewy.
