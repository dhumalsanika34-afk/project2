Homemade Preparation Tips
Crispy Crust: Use a cast-iron skillet, heating it on the stove and finishing it under the broiler for 1-2 minutes.
Topping Prep: Toss cooked chicken in BBQ sauce before placing it on the pizza to prevent it from drying out.
Cheese Selection: Shred your own cheese from a block for better melting, rather than using pre-shredded bags.
Avoid Soggy Crust: Bake the crust for 5-10 minutes before adding toppings, and ensure toppings are not too wet.
